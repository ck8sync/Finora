# Finora Client (Vite + React)

This folder will contain the Vite React app for the Finora frontend.

To create the client app locally, run these commands from the project root in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd finora-hub
npm create vite@latest client -- --template react
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will serve the app on http://localhost:5173 by default.
